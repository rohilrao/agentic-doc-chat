<summary><strong>ðŸ”‘ Key Ideas & Future Directions</strong></summary>

- Shift from monolithic LLMs to ecosystems of smaller, specialized agents  
- Post-training (e.g., RL, SFT) on static, domain-specific datasets boosts performance  
- Retrieval isn't enough â€” embed domain knowledge directly via fine-tuning  
- Agentic AI frameworks for reliable, multi-step reasoning in safety-critical tasks  
- Explore NeuroSymbolic methods for interpretability (e.g., via KGs)
